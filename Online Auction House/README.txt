Python 3.

Just something I came up with to apply what I've learned about Flask.

Users can create an account, log in , log out, become admins.
Items belonging to users can be put on auction and users can bid on eachothers items.

User and auction information is stored on and retrieved from a mysql database using SQLAlchemy.
